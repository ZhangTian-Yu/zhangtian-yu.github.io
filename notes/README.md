# Tianyu Zhang

I am Tianyu Zhang, an undergraduate from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I am interested in **theoretical computer science**, with my current focus on **zero-knowledge proofs**.

I writes **blogs** and **notes**. Blogs offer my thinkings and notes offer my conceptualization of knowledges.
