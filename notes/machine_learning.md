machine learning

Another prevailing name is artificial intelligence, which affirmatively answer a NP problem about machine learning, where human of limited space, time and energy serves as a witness/proof of the question that whether it’s possible to build something at least as intelligent as human.

The grail of machine learning: to build a machine that learns from world and interacts with the world successfully. 
Under the conceptualization framework of computer science, the grail is to build a machine learns from data and functions on data successfully, as data, or literal string, or input tape of turing machine is general enough to capture concepts of computer science objects, while “successfully” retains its concept intent in real world.

The gaps between the our machine and the best machine:

- The model gap: the model constructed by the machine architecture can only learn to be a subset of all possible machines by varying its parameters.The approximation theory answers whether a machine can approximate any possible  machine, partially bridging this gap.

- The metric gap: the metric used to measure the success of interaction between the machine and the world is diverge from the ideal one, while the ideal metric itself is ambiguous in reality.The statistics theory answers the difference between population and sample performance, partially bridging this gap.
- The algorithm gap: the learning of the machine takes the form of the algorithm, whose inherent efficiency requirement determines the machine cannot be optimized to its best over the metric but depend on the architecture, metric and algorithm altogether.The optimization theory answers how to get close to global minimal of convex or non-convex functions.

Typical the process of machine learning is divided into two stages: the learning stage and the functioning stage.

“It’s not the destination, it’s the journey” or Anna Karenina principle says that successful machines learn the same representation and thus have power to generalize.

“No free lunch” or Goodhart’s law says a machine cannot function universally successfully.
